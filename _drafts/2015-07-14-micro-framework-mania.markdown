The PHP world loves a good micro-framework. Micro-frameworks are stunningly fast, low footprint and brilliant for everything from a small personal website to enterprise level applications.

Three of the most common PHP micro-frameworks that you will encounter are Silex, Slim and Lumen. If you've written an application using any of these frameworks, turning it into a FastCGI application is now trivial.

Our three latest packages, **Speedex** for Silex, **Slimmer** for Slim and **Flash** for Lumen glue the micro-framework to the FastCGIDaemon for you.
