Welcome to the website for the PHPFastCGI project. I'm going to use this space to post updates on the project, document features and show examples - all with the aim of making the software easier to use.

There are lots of new features in the pipeline that I'll soon be integrating into the project. On the horizon is micro-framework integration, complete PSR-7 support and much more.

I'm hoping to have a first stable release of this software ready by September 2015, so please watch this space if you find this project interesting.
